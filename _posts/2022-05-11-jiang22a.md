title: Data-Augmented Contact Model for Rigid Body Simulation
abstract: 'Accurately modeling contact behaviors for real-world, near-rigid materials
  remains a grand challenge for existing rigid-body physics simulators. This paper
  introduces a data-augmented contact model that incorporates analytical solutions
  with observed data to predict the 3D contact impulse which could result in rigid
  bodies bouncing, sliding or spinning in all directions. Our method enhances the
  expressiveness of the standard Coulomb contact model by learning the contact behaviors
  from the observed data, while preserving the fundamental contact constraints whenever
  possible. For example, a classifier is trained to approximate the transitions between
  static and dynamic frictions, while non-penetration constraint during collision
  is enforced analytically. Our method computes the aggregated effect of contact for
  the entire rigid body, instead of predicting the contact force for each contact
  point individually, maintaining same simulation speed as the number of contact points
  increases for detailed geometries. Supplemental video: https://shorturl.at/eilwX'
