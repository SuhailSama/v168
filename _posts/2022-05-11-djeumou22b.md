title: 'Learning to Reach, Swim, Walk and Fly in One Trial: Data-Driven Control with
  Scarce Data and Side Information'
abstract: We develop a learning-based control algorithm for unknown dynamical systems
  under very severe data limitations. Specifically, the algorithm has access to streaming
  and noisy data only from a single and ongoing trial. It accomplishes such performance
  by effectively leveraging various forms of side information on the dynamics to reduce
  the sample complexity. Such side information typically comes from elementary laws
  of physics and qualitative properties of the system. More precisely, the algorithm
  approximately solves an optimal control problem encoding the system’s desired behavior.
  To this end, it constructs and iteratively refines a data-driven differential inclusion
  that contains the unknown vector field of the dynamics. The differential inclusion,
  used in an interval Taylor-based method, enables to over-approximate the set of
  states the system may reach. Theoretically, we establish a bound on the suboptimality
  of the approximate solution with respect to the optimal control with known dynamics.
  We show that the longer the trial or the more side information is available, the
  tighter the bound. Empirically, experiments in a high-fidelity F-16 aircraft simulator
  and MuJoCo’s environments illustrate that, despite the scarcity of data, the algorithm
  can provide performance comparable to reinforcement learning algorithms trained
  over millions of environment interactions. Besides, we show that the algorithm outperforms
  existing techniques combining system identification and model predictive control.
