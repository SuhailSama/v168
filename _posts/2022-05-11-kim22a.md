title: Convergence and Stability of the Stochastic Proximal Point Algorithm with Momentum
abstract: 'Stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGDM) is the dominant algorithm
  in many optimization scenarios, including convex optimization instances and non-convex
  neural network training. Yet, in the stochastic setting, momentum interferes with
  gradient noise, often leading to specific step size and momentum choices in order
  to guarantee convergence, set aside acceleration. Proximal point methods, on the
  other hand, have gained much attention due to their numerical stability and elasticity
  against imperfect tuning. Their stochastic accelerated variants though have received
  limited attention: how momentum interacts with the stability of (stochastic) proximal
  point methods remains largely unstudied. To address this, we focus on the convergence
  and stability of the stochastic proximal point algorithm with momentum (SPPAM),
  and show that SPPAM allows a faster linear convergence to a neighborhood compared
  to stochastic proximal point algorithm (SPPA) with a better contraction factor,
  under proper hyperparameter tuning. In terms of stability, we show that SPPAM depends
  on problem constants more favorably than SGDM, allowing a wider range of step size
  and momentum that lead to convergence.'
