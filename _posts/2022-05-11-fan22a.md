title: 'PowerGym: A Reinforcement Learning Environment for Volt-Var Control in Power
  Distribution Systems'
abstract: Reinforcement learning for power distribution systems has so far been studied
  using customized environments due to the proprietary nature of the power industry.
  To encourage researchers to benchmark reinforcement learning algorithms, we introduce
  PowerGym, an open-source reinforcement learning environment for Volt-Var control
  in power distribution systems. Following OpenAI Gym APIs, PowerGym targets minimizing
  power losses and voltage violations under physical networked constraints. PowerGym
  provides four distribution systems (13Bus, 34Bus, 123Bus, and 8500Node) based on
  IEEE benchmark systems and design variants for various control difficulties. To
  foster generalization, PowerGym offers a detailed customization guide for users
  working with their distribution systems. As a demonstration, we examine state-of-the-art
  reinforcement learning algorithms in PowerGym  and validate the environment by studying
  controller behaviors.  The repository is available at https://github.com/siemens/powergym.
