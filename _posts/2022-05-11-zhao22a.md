title: Data-driven Control of Unknown Linear Systems via Quantized Feedback
abstract: Control using quantized feedback is a fundamental approach to system synthesis
  with limited communication capacity. In this paper, we address the stabilization
  problem for unknown linear systems with logarithmically quantized feedback, via
  a direct data-driven control method. By leveraging a recently developed matrix S-lemma,
  we prove a sufficient and necessary condition for the existence of a common stabilizing
  controller for all possible dynamics consistent with data, in the form of a linear
  matrix inequality. Moreover, we formulate a semi-definite programming problem to
  solve the coarsest quantization density. By establishing its connections to unstable
  eigenvalues of the state matrix, we further prove a necessary rank condition on
  the data for quantized feedback stabilization. Finally, we validate our theoretical
  results by numerical examples.
