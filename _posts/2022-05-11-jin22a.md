title: Learning Linear Complementarity Systems
abstract: This paper investigates the learning, or system identification, of a class
  of piecewise-affine dynamical systems known as linear complementarity systems (LCSs).
  We propose a violation-based loss which enables efficient learning of the LCS parameterization,
  without prior knowledge of the hybrid mode boundaries, using gradient-based methods.
  The proposed violation-based loss incorporates both dynamics prediction loss and
  a novel complementarity - violation loss. We show several properties attained by
  this loss formulation, including its differentiability, the efficient computation
  of first- and second-order derivatives, and its relationship to the traditional
  prediction loss, which strictly enforces complementarity. We apply this violation-based
  loss formulation to learn LCSs with tens of thousands of (potentially stiff) hybrid
  modes. The results demonstrate a state-of-the-art ability to identify piecewise-affine
  dynamics, outperforming methods which must differentiate through non-smooth linear
  complementarity problems.
