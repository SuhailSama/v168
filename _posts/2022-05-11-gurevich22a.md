title: 'Optimal Control with Learning on the Fly: System with Unknown Drift'
abstract: 'This paper derives an optimal control strategy for a simple stochastic
  dynamical system with constant drift and an additive control input. Motivated by
  the example of a physical system with an unexpected change in its dynamics, we take
  the drift parameter to be unknown, so that it must be learned while controlling
  the system. The state of the system is observed through a linear observation model
  with Gaussian noise. In contrast to most previous work, which focuses on a controller’s
  asymptotic performance over an infinite time horizon, we minimize a quadratic cost
  function over a finite time horizon. The performance of our control strategy is
  quantified by comparing its cost with the cost incurred by an optimal controller
  that has full knowledge of the parameters. This approach gives rise to several notions
  of “regret.” We derive a set of control strategies that provably minimize the worst-case
  regret, which arise from Bayesian strategies that assume a specific fixed prior
  on the drift parameter. This work suggests that examining Bayesian strategies may
  lead to optimal or near-optimal control strategies for a much larger class of realistic
  dynamical models with unknown parameters. '
