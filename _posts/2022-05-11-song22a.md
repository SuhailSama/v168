title: Online No-regret Model-Based Meta RL for Personalized Navigation
abstract: The interaction between a vehicle navigation system and the driver of the
  vehicle can be formulated as a model-based reinforcement learning problem, where
  the navigation systems (agent) must quickly adapt to the characteristics of the
  driver (environmental dynamics) to provide the best sequence of turn-by-turn driving
  instructions. Most modern day navigation systems (e.g, Google maps, Waze, Garmin)
  are not designed to personalize their low-level interactions for individual users
  across a wide range of driving styles (e.g., vehicle type, reaction time, level
  of expertise). Towards the development of personalized navigation systems that adapt
  to a variety of driving styles, we propose an online no-regret model-based RL method
  that quickly conforms to the dynamics of the current user. As the user interacts
  with it, the navigation system quickly builds a user-specific model, from which
  navigation commands are optimized using model predictive control. By personalizing
  the policy in this way, our method is able to give well-timed driving instructions
  that match the userâ€™s dynamics. Our theoretical analysis shows that our method is
  a no-regret algorithm and we provide the convergence rate in the agnostic setting.
  Our empirical analysis with 60+ hours of real-world user data using a driving simulator
  shows that our method can reduce the number of collisions by more than 60%.
