title: 'Learning POMDP Models with Similarity Space Regularization: a Linear Gaussian
  Case Study'
abstract: Partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) is a principled framework
  for sequential decision making and control under uncertainty. Classical POMDP methods
  assume known system models, while in real-world applications, the true models are
  usually unknown. Recent researches propose learning POMDP models from the observation
  sequences rolled out by the true system using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE).
  However, we find that such methods usually fail to find a desirable solution. This
  paper makes a profound study of the POMDP model learning problem, focusing on the
  linear Gaussian case. We show the objective of MLE is a high-order polynomial function,
  which makes it easy to get stuck in local optima. We then prove that the global
  optimal models are not unique and constitute a similarity space of the true model.
  Based on this view, we propose Similarity Space Regularization (SimReg), an algorithm
  that smooths out the local optima but keeps all the global optima. Experiments show
  that given only a biased prior model, our algorithm achieves a higher log-likelihood,
  more accurate observation reconstruction and state estimation compared with the
  MLE-based method.
