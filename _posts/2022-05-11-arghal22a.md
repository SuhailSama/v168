title: Robust Graph Neural Networks via Probabilistic Lipschitz Constraints
abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently been demonstrated to perform
  well on a variety of network-based tasks such as decentralized control and resource
  allocation, and provide computationally efficient methods for these tasks which
  have traditionally been challenging in that regard. However, like many neural-network
  based systems, GNNs are susceptible to shifts and perturbations on their inputs,
  which can include both node attributes and graph structure. In order to make them
  more useful for real-world applications, it is important to ensure their robustness
  post-deployment. Motivated by controlling the Lipschitz constant of GNN filters
  with respect to the node attributes, we  propose to constrain the frequency response
  of the GNNâ€™s filter banks. We extend this formulation to the dynamic graph setting
  using a continuous frequency response constraint, and solve a relaxed variant of
  the problem via the scenario approach. This allows for the use of the same computationally
  efficient algorithm on sampled constraints, which provides PAC-style guarantees
  on the stability of the GNN using results in scenario optimization. We also highlight
  an important connection between this setup and GNN stability to graph perturbations,
  and provide experimental results which demonstrate the efficacy and broadness of
  our approach.
