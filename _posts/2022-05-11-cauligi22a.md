title: 'PRISM: Recurrent Neural Networks and Presolve Methods for Fast Mixed-integer
  Optimal Control'
abstract: 'While mixed-integer convex programs (MICPs) arise frequently in mixed-integer
  optimal control problems (MIOCPs), current state-of-the-art MICP solvers are often
  too slow for real-time applications, limiting the practicality of MICP-based controller
  design. Although supervised learning has been proposed to hasten the solution of
  MICPs via convex approximations, they are not designed to scale well to problems
  with >100 decision variables. In this paper, we present PRISM: Presolve and Recurrent
  network-based mixed-Integer Solution Method, to leverage deep recurrent neural network
  (RNN) architectures such as long short-term memory (LSTMs) networks, in conjunction
  with numerical optimization tools to enable scalable acceleration of MICPs arising
  in MIOCPs. Our key insight is to learn the underlying temporal structure of MIOCPs
  and to combine this with presolve routines employed in MICP solvers. We demonstrate
  how PRISM can lead to significant performance improvements, compared to branch-and-bound
  (B&B) methods and to existing supervised learning techniques, for stabilizing a
  cart-pole with contact dynamics, and a motion planning problem under obstacle avoidance
  constraints.'
