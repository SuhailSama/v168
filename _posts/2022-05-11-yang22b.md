title: Input-to-State Stable Neural Ordinary Differential Equations with Applications
  to Transient Modeling of Circuits
abstract: This paper proposes a class of neural ordinary differential equations parametrized
  by provably input-to-state stable continuous-time recurrent neural networks. The
  model dynamics are defined by construction to be input-to-state stable (ISS) with
  respect to an ISS-Lyapunov function that is learned jointly with the dynamics. We
  use the proposed method to learn cheap-to-simulate behavioral models for electronic
  circuits that can accurately reproduce the behavior of various digital and analog
  circuits when simulated by a commercial circuit simulator, even when interconnected
  with circuit components not encountered during training. We also demonstrate the
  feasibility of learning ISS-preserving perturbations to the dynamics for modeling
  degradation effects due to circuit aging.
