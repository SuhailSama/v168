title: Learning Reversible Symplectic Dynamics
abstract: Time-reversal symmetry arises naturally as a structural property in many
  dynamical systems of interest. While the importance of hard-wiring symmetry is increasingly
  recognized in machine learning, to date this has eluded time-reversibility. In this
  paper, we propose a new neural network architecture for learning time-reversible
  dynamical systems from data. We focus in particular on an adaptation to symplectic
  systems, because of their importance in physics-informed learning.
