title: Distributed Control using Reinforcement Learning with Temporal-Logic-Based
  Reward Shaping
abstract: We present a computational framework for synthesis of distributed control
  strategies for a heterogeneous team of robots in a partially observable environment.
  The goal is to cooperatively satisfy specifications given as Truncated Linear Temporal
  Logic (TLTL) formulas. Our approach formulates the synthesis problem as a stochastic
  game and employs a policy graph method to find a control strategy with memory for
  each agent. We construct the stochastic game on the product between the team transition
  system and a finite state automaton (FSA) that tracks the satisfaction of the TLTL
  formula. We use the quantitative semantics of TLTL as the reward of the game, and
  further reshape it using the FSA to guide and accelerate the learning process. Simulation
  results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed solution under demanding task specifications
  and the effectiveness of reward shaping in significantly accelerating the speed
  of learning.
