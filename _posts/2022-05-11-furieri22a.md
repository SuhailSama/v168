title: 'Distributed Neural Network Control with Dependability Guarantees: a Compositional
  Port-Hamiltonian Approach'
abstract: Large-scale cyber-physical systems require that control policies are distributed,
  that is, that they only rely on local real-time measurements and communication with
  neighboring agents. Optimal Distributed Control (ODC) problems are, however, highly
  intractable even in seemingly simple cases. Recent work has thus proposed training
  Neural Network (NN) distributed controllers. A main challenge of NN controllers
  is that they are not dependable during and after training, that is, the closed-loop  system
  may be unstable, and the training may fail due to vanishing gradients. In this paper,
  we address these issues for networks of nonlinear port-Hamiltonian (pH) systems,
  whose modeling power ranges from energy systems to non-holonomic vehicles and chemical
  reactions. Specifically, we embrace the compositional properties of pH systems to
  characterize deep Hamiltonian control policies with built-in closed-loop stability
  guarantees – irrespective of the interconnection topology and the chosen NN parameters.
  Furthermore, our setup enables leveraging recent results on well-behaved neural
  ODEs to prevent the phenomenon of vanishing gradients by design. Numerical experiments
  corroborate the dependability of the proposed architecture, while matching the performance
  of general neural network policies.
