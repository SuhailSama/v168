title: 'Robustness Certificates for Implicit Neural Networks: A Mixed Monotone Contractive
  Approach'
abstract: Implicit neural networks are a general class of learning models that replace
  the layers in traditional feedforward models with implicit algebraic equations.
  Compared to traditional learning models, implicit networks offer competitive performance
  and reduced memory consumption. However, they can remain brittle with respect to
  input adversarial perturbations.  This paper proposes a theoretical and computational
  framework for robustness verification of implicit neural networks; our framework
  blends together mixed monotone systems theory and contraction theory. First, given
  an implicit neural network, we introduce a related embedded network and show that,
  given an infinity-norm box constraint on the input, the embedded network provides
  an infinity-norm box overapproximation for the output of the original network. Second,
  using infinity-matrix measures, we propose sufficient conditions for well-posedness
  of both the original and embedded system and design an iterative algorithm to compute
  the infinity-norm box robustness margins for reachability and classification problems.
  Third, of independent value, we show that employing a suitable relative classifier
  variable in our analysis will lead to tighter bounds on the certified adversarial
  robustness in classification problems. Finally, we perform numerical simulations
  on a Non-Euclidean Monotone Operator Network (NEMON) trained on the MNIST dataset.
  In these simulations, we compare the accuracy and run time of our mixed monotone
  contractive approach with the existing robustness verification approaches in the
  literature for estimating the certified adversarial robustness.
