title: Safe Autonomous Navigation for Systems with Learned SE(3) Hamiltonian Dynamics
abstract: Safe autonomous navigation in unknown environments is an important problem
  for mobile robots. This paper proposes techniques to learn the dynamics model of
  a mobile robot from trajectory data and synthesize a tracking controller with safety
  and stability guarantees. The state of a rigid-body robot usually contains its position,
  orientation, and generalized velocity and satisfies Hamilton’s equations of motion.
  Instead of a hand-derived dynamics model, we use a dataset of state-control trajectories
  to train a translation-equivariant nonlinear Hamiltonian model represented as a
  neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) network. The learned Hamiltonian model
  is used to synthesize an energy-shaping passivity-based controller and derive conditions
  which guarantee safe regulation to a desired reference pose. We enable adaptive
  tracking of a desired path, subject to safety constraints obtained from obstacle
  distance measurements. The trade-off between the robot’s energy and the distance
  to safety constraint violation is used to adaptively govern a reference pose along
  the desired path. Our safe adaptive controller is demonstrated on a simulated hexarotor
  robot navigating in an unknown environments.
