title: Adversarially Regularized Policy Learning Guided by Trajectory Optimization
abstract: Recent advancement in combining trajectory optimization with function approximation
  (especially neural networks) shows promise in learning complex control policies
  for diverse tasks in robot systems. Despite their great flexibility, the large neural
  networks for parameterizing control policies impose significant challenges. The
  learned neural control policies are often overcomplex and non-smooth, which can
  easily cause unexpected or diverging robot motions. Therefore, they often yield
  poor generalization performance in practice. To address this issue, we propose adversarially
  regularized policy learning guided by trajectory optimization (VERONICA) for learning
  smooth control policies. Specifically, our proposed approach controls the smoothness
  (local Lipschitz continuity) of the neural control policies by stabilizing the output
  control with respect to the worst-case perturbation to the input state. Our experiments
  on robot manipulation show that our proposed approach not only improves the sample
  efficiency of neural policy learning but also enhances the robustness of the policy
  against various types of disturbances, including sensor noise, environmental uncertainty,
  and model mismatch.
