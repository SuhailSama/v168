title: A Piecewise Learning Framework for Control of Unknown Nonlinear Systems with
  Stability Guarantees
abstract: We propose a piecewise learning framework for controlling nonlinear systems
  with unknown dynamics. While model-based reinforcement learning techniques in terms
  of some basis functions are well known in the literature, when it comes to more
  complex dynamics, only a local approximation of the model can be obtained using
  a limited number of bases. The complexity of the identifier and the controller can
  be considerably high if obtaining an approximation over a larger domain is desired.
  To overcome this limitation, we propose a general piecewise nonlinear framework
  where each piece is responsible for locally learning and controlling over some region
  of the domain. We obtain rigorous uncertainty bounds for the learned piecewise models.
  The piecewise affine (PWA) model is then studied as a special case, for which we
  propose an optimization-based verification technique for stability analysis of the
  closed-loop system. Accordingly, given a time-discretization of the learned PWA
  system, we iteratively search for a common piecewise Lyapunov function in a set
  of positive definite functions, where a non-monotonic convergence is allowed. This
  Lyapunov candidate is verified on the uncertain system to either provide a certificate
  for stability or find a counter-example when it fails. This  counter-example is
  added to a set of samples to facilitate the further learning of a Lyapunov function.
  We demonstrate the results on two examples and show that the proposed approach yields
  a less conservative region of attraction (ROA) compared with alternative state-of-the-art
  approaches. Moreover, we provide the runtime results to demonstrate potentials of
  the proposed framework in real-world implementations.
