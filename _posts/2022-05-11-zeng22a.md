title: 'Learning to Coordinate in Multi-Agent Systems: A Coordinated Actor-Critic
  Algorithm and Finite-Time Guarantees'
abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has attracted much research attention
  recently. However, unlike its single-agent counterpart, many theoretical and algorithmic
  aspects of MARL have not been well-understood. In this paper, we study the emergence
  of coordinated behavior by autonomous agents using an actor-critic (AC) algorithm.
  Specifically, we propose and analyze a class of coordinated actor-critic (CAC) algorithms
  in which individually parametrized policies have a shared part (which is jointly
  optimized among all agents) and a personalized part (which is only locally optimized).
  Such a kind of partially personalized policy allows agents to coordinate by leveraging
  peersâ€™ experience and adapt to individual tasks. The flexibility in our design allows
  the proposed CAC algorithm to be used in a fully decentralized setting, where the
  agents can only communicate with their neighbors, as well as in a federated setting,
  where the agents occasionally communicate with a server while optimizing their (partially
  personalized) local models. Theoretically, we show that under some standard regularity
  assumptions, the proposed CAC algorithm requires $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-\frac{5}{2}}
  )$ samples to achieve an $\epsilon$-stationary solution (defined as the solution
  whose squared norm of the gradient of the objective function is less than $\epsilon$).
  To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first finite-sample guarantee
  for decentralized AC algorithm with partially personalized policies.
