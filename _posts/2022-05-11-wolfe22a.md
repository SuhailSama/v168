title: 'i-SpaSP: Structured Neural Pruning via Sparse Signal Recovery'
abstract: We propose a novel, structured pruning algorithm for neural networks—the
  iterative, Sparse Structured Pruning algorithm, dubbed as i-SpaSP. Inspired by ideas
  from sparse signal recovery, i-SpaSP operates by iteratively identifying a larger
  set of important parameter groups (e.g., filters or neurons) within a network that
  contribute most to the residual between pruned and dense network output, then thresholding
  these groups based on a smaller, pre-defined pruning ratio. For both two-layer and
  multi-layer network architectures with ReLU activations, we show the error induced
  by pruning with i-SpaSP decays polynomially, where the degree of this polynomial
  becomes arbitrarily large based on the sparsity of the dense network’s hidden representations.
  In our experiments, i-SpaSP is evaluated across a variety of datasets (i.e., MNIST,
  ImageNet, and XNLI) and architectures (i.e., feed forward networks, ResNet34, MobileNetV2,
  and BERT), where it is shown to discover high-performing sub-networks and improve
  upon the pruning efficiency of provable baseline methodologies by several orders
  of magnitude. Put simply, i-SpaSP is easy to implement with automatic differentiation,
  achieves strong empirical results, comes with theoretical convergence guarantees,
  and is efficient, thus distinguishing itself as one of the few computationally efficient,
  practical, and provable pruning algorithms.
