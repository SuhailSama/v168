title: 'OpReg-Boost: Learning to Accelerate Online Algorithms with Operator Regression'
abstract: This paper presents a new regularization approach – termed OpReg-Boost –
  to boost the convergence of online optimization and learning algorithms. In particular,
  the paper considers online  algorithms for optimization problems with a time-varying
  (weakly) convex composite cost. For a given online algorithm, OpReg-Boost learns
  the closest algorithmic map that yields linear convergence; to this end, the learning
  procedure hinges on the concept of operator regression. We show how to formalize
  the operator regression problem and propose a computationally-efficient Peaceman-Rachford
  solver that exploits a closed-form solution of simple quadratically-constrained
  quadratic programs (QCQPs). Simulation results showcase the superior properties
  of OpReg-Boost w.r.t. the more classical forward-backward algorithm, FISTA, and
  Anderson acceleration.
