title: Traversing Time with Multi-Resolution Gaussian Process State-Space Models
abstract: Gaussian Process state-space models capture complex temporal dependencies
  in a principled manner by placing a Gaussian Process prior on the transition function.
  These models have a natural interpretation as discretized stochastic differential
  equations, but inference for long sequences with fast and slow transitions is difficult.
  Fast transitions need tight discretizations whereas slow transitions require backpropagating
  the gradients over long subtrajectories. We propose a novel Gaussian process state-space
  architecture composed of multiple components, each trained on a different resolution,
  to model effects on different timescales. The combined model allows traversing time
  on adaptive scales, providing efficient inference for arbitrarily long sequences
  with complex dynamics. We benchmark our novel method on semi-synthetic data and
  on an engine modeling task. In both experiments, our approach compares favorably
  against its state-of-the-art alternatives that operate on a single time-scale only.
