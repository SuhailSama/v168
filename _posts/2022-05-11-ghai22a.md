title: Robust Online Control with Model Misspecification
abstract: We study online control of an unknown nonlinear dynamical system that is
  approximated by a time-invariant linear system with  model misspecification. Our
  study focuses on  robustness, a measure of how much deviation from the assumed linear
  approximation can be tolerated by a controller while maintaining finite L2-gain.
  A basic methodology to analyze robustness is via the small gain theorem.  However,
  as an implication of recent lower bounds on adaptive control, this method can only
  yield robustness  that is exponentially small in the dimension of the system and
  its parametric uncertainty. The work of Cusumano and Poolla (1988) shows that much
  better robustness can be obtained, but the control algorithm is inefficient, taking
  exponential time in the worst case. In this paper we investigate whether there exists
  an efficient algorithm with provable robustness beyond the small gain theorem. We
  demonstrate that for a fully actuated system, this is indeed attainable. We give
  an efficient controller that can tolerate robustness that is polynomial in the dimension
  and independent of the parametric uncertainty; furthermore, the controller obtains
  an L2-gain whose dimension dependence is near optimal.
