title: Gradient and Projection Free Distributed Online Min-Max Resource Optimization
abstract: We consider distributed online min-max resource allocation with a set of
  parallel agents and a parameter server. Our goal is to minimize the pointwise maximum
  over a set of time-varying and decreasing cost functions, without a priori information
  about these functions. We propose a novel online algorithm, termed Distributed Online
  resource Re-Allocation (DORA), where non-stragglers learn to relinquish resource
  and share resource with stragglers. A notable feature of DORA is that it does not
  require gradient calculation or projection operation, unlike most existing online
  optimization strategies. This allows it to substantially reduce the computation
  overhead in large-scale and distributed networks. We show that the dynamic regret
  of the proposed algorithm is upper bounded by O(T^{3/4}(1+P_T)^{1/4}), where T is
  the total number of rounds and P_T is the path-length of the instantaneous minimizers.
  We further consider an application to the bandwidth allocation problem in distributed
  online machine learning. Our numerical study demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed
  solution and its performance advantage over gradient- and/or projection-based resource
  allocation algorithms in reducing wall-clock time.
