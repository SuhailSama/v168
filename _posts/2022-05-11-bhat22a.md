title: Dynamic Learning of Correlation Potentials for a Time-Dependent Kohn-Sham System
abstract: We develop methods to learn the correlation potential for a time-dependent
  Kohn-Sham (TDKS) system in one spatial dimension.  We start from a low-dimensional
  two-electron system for which we can numerically solve the time-dependent Schr√∂dinger
  equation; this yields electron densities suitable for training models of the correlation
  potential.  We frame the learning problem as one of optimizing a least-squares objective
  subject to the constraint that the dynamics obey the TDKS equation.  Applying adjoints,
  we develop efficient methods to compute gradients and thereby learn models of the
  correlation potential.  Our results show that it is possible to learn values of
  the correlation potential such that the resulting electron densities match ground
  truth densities.  We also show how to learn correlation potential functionals with
  memory, demonstrating one such model that yields reasonable results for trajectories
  outside the training set.
