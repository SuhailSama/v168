title: Diffeomorphic Transforms for Generalised Imitation Learning
abstract: 'We address the generalised imitation learning problem of producing robot
  motions to imitate expert demonstrations, while adapting to novel environments.
  Past studies have often focused on methods that closely mimic demonstrations. However,
  to operate reliably in novel environments, robots should be able to adapt their
  learned motions accordingly. Motivated by this, we devise a framework capable of
  learning a time-invariant dynamical system to imitate demonstrations, and generalise
  to account for changes to the surroundings. To ensure the system is robust to perturbations,
  we need to maintain its stability. Our framework enforces stability in a principled
  manner: we start with a known stable system and use differentiable bijections (diffeomorphisms)
  to morph the system into the desired target system. We modularise robot motion and
  develop diffeomorphic transforms to encode individual actions. A composition of
  transforms produces generalised behaviour that complies with multiple requirements,
  such as mimicking demonstrations while avoiding obstacles. We evaluate our framework
  in both simulation and on a real-world 6-DOF JACO manipulator. Results show our
  framework is capable of producing a stable system that is collision-free and incorporates
  user-specified biases, while closely resembling demonstrations.'
