title: Learning-Enabled Robust Control with Noisy Measurements
abstract: We present a constructive approach to bounded l2-gain adaptive control with
  noisy measurements for linear time-invariant scalar systems with uncertain parameters
  belonging to a finite set. The gain bound refers to the closed-loop system, including
  the learning procedure. The approach is based on forward dynamic programming to
  construct a finite-dimensional information state consisting of H-infinity-observers
  paired with a recursively computed performance metric. We do not assume prior knowledge
  of a stabilizing controller.
