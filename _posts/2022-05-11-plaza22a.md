title: Total Energy Shaping with Neural Interconnection and Damping Assignment - Passivity
  Based Control
abstract: In this work we exploit the universal approximation property of Neural Networks
  (NNs) to design interconnection and damping assignment (IDA) passivity-based control
  (PBC) schemes for fully-actuated mechanical systems in the port-Hamiltonian (pH)
  framework. To that end, we transform the IDA-PBC method into a supervised learning
  problem that solves the partial differential matching equations, and fulfills equilibrium
  assignment and Lyapunov stability conditions. A main consequence of this, is that
  the output of the learning algorithm has a clear control-theoretic interpretation
  in terms of passivity and Lyapunov stability.The proposed control design methodology
  is validated for  mechanical systems of one and two degrees-of-freedom via numerical
  simulations.
