title: Distributed Stochastic Nash Equilibrium Learning in Locally Coupled Network
  Games with Unknown Parameters
abstract: In stochastic Nash equilibrium problems (SNEPs), it is natural for players
  to be uncertain about their complex environments and have multi-dimensional unknown
  parameters in their models. Among various SNEPs, this paper focuses on locally coupled
  network games where the objective of each rational player is subject to the aggregate
  influence of its neighbors. We propose a distributed learning algorithm based on
  the proximal-point iteration and ordinary least-square estimator, where each player
  repeatedly updates the local estimates of neighboring decisions, makes its augmented
  best-response decisions given the current estimated parameters, receives the realized
  objective values, and learns the unknown parameters. Leveraging the Robbins-Siegmund
  theorem and the law of large deviations for M-estimators, we establish the almost
  sure convergence of the proposed algorithm to solutions of SNEPs when the updating
  step sizes decay at a proper rate.
