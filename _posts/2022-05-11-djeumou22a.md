title: Neural Networks with Physics-Informed Architectures and Constraints for Dynamical
  Systems Modeling
abstract: Effective inclusion of physics-based knowledge into deep neural network
  models of dynamical systems can greatly improve data efficiency and generalization.
  Such a priori knowledge might arise from physical principles (e.g., conservation
  laws) or from the system’s design (e.g., the Jacobian matrix of a robot), even if
  large portions of the system dynamics remain unknown. We develop a framework to
  learn dynamics models from trajectory data while incorporating a priori system knowledge
  as inductive bias. More specifically, the proposed framework uses physics-based
  side information to inform the structure of the neural network itself, and to place
  constraints on the values of the outputs and the internal states of the model. It
  represents the system’s vector field as a composition of known and unknown functions,
  the latter of which are parametrized by neural networks. The physics-informed constraints
  are enforced via the augmented Lagrangian method during the model’s training. We
  experimentally demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach on a variety of
  dynamical systems – including a benchmark suite of robotics environments featuring
  large state spaces, non-linear dynamics, external forces, contact forces, and control
  inputs. By exploiting a priori system knowledge during training, the proposed approach
  learns to predict the system dynamics two orders of magnitude more accurately than
  a baseline approach that does not include prior knowledge, given the same training
  dataset.
