title: Generalization Bounded Implicit Learning of Nearly Discontinuous Functions
abstract: 'Inspired by recent strides in empirical efficacy of implicit learning in
  many robotics tasks, we seek to understand the theoretical benefits of implicit
  formulations in the face of nearly discontinuous functions, common characteristics
  for systems that make and break contact with the environment such as in legged locomotion
  and manipulation.  We present and motivate three formulations for learning a function:  one
  explicit and two implicit.  We derive generalization bounds for each of these three
  approaches, exposing where explicit and implicit methods alike based on prediction
  error losses typically fail to produce tight bounds, in contrast to other implicit
  methods with violation-based loss definitions that can be fundamentally more robust
  to steep slopes.  Furthermore, we demonstrate that this violation implicit loss
  can tightly bound graph distance, a quantity that often has physical roots and handles
  noise in inputs and outputs alike, instead of prediction losses which consider output
  noise only.  Our insights into the generalizability and physical relevance of violation
  implicit formulations match evidence from prior works and are validated through
  a toy problem, inspired by rigid-contact models and referenced throughout our theoretical
  analysis.'
