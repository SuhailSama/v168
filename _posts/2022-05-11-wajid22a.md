title: Formal Synthesis of Safety Controllers for Unknown Stochastic Control Systems
  using Gaussian Process Learning
abstract: Formal synthesis of controllers for stochastic control systems with unknown
  models is a challenging problem. In this paper, we focus on safety controller synthesis
  for nonlinear stochastic control systems. The approach consists of a learning step
  followed by a controller synthesis scheme using control barrier functions. In the
  learning phase, we employ Gaussian processes (GP) to learn models of unknown stochastic
  control systems in the presence of both process and measurement noises. In the controller
  synthesis phase, we compute control barrier functions together with their corresponding
  controllers based on the learned GP and quantify lower bounds on the probabilities
  of safety satisfaction for the original unknown systems equipped with the synthesized
  controllers. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated
  on a room temperature control and a vehicle lane-keeping example.
