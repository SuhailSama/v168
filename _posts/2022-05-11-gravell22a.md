title: Robust Data-Driven Output Feedback Control via Bootstrapped Multiplicative
  Noise
abstract: 'We propose a robust data-driven output feedback control algorithm that
  explicitly incorporates inherent finite-sample model estimate uncertainties into
  the control design. The algorithm has three components: (1) a subspace identification
  nominal model estimator; (2) a bootstrap resampling method that quantifies non-asymptotic
  variance of the nominal model estimate; and (3) a non-conventional robust control
  design method comprising a coupled optimal dynamic output feedback filter and controller
  with multiplicative noise. A key advantage of the proposed approach is that the
  system identification and robust control design procedures both use stochastic uncertainty
  representations, so that the actual inherent statistical estimation uncertainty
  directly aligns with the uncertainty the robust controller is being designed against.
  Moreover, the control design method accommodates a highly structured uncertainty
  representation that can capture uncertainty shape more effectively than existing
  approaches. We show through numerical experiments that the proposed robust data-driven
  output feedback controller can significantly outperform a certainty equivalent controller
  on various measures of sample complexity and stability robustness.'
