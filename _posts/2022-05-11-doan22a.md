title: Convergence Rates of Two-Time-Scale Gradient Descent-Ascent Dynamics for Solving
  Nonconvex Min-Max Problems
abstract: There are much recent interests in solving noncovnex min-max optimization
  problems due to its broad applications in many areas including machine learning,
  networked resource allocations, and distributed optimization. Perhaps, the most
  popular first-order method in solving min-max optimization is the so-called simultaneous
  (or single-loop) gradient descent-ascent algorithm due to its simplicity in implementation.
  However, theoretical guarantees on the convergence of this algorithm are very sparse
  since it can diverge even in a simple bilinear problem. In this paper, our focus
  is to characterize the finite-time performance (or convergence rates) of the continuous-time
  variant of simultaneous gradient descent-ascent algorithm. In particular, we derive
  the rates of convergence of this method under a number of different conditions on
  the underlying objective function, namely, two-sided Polyak-Ł{ojasiewicz} (PŁ),
  one-sided PŁ{}, nonconvex-strongly concave, and strongly convex-nonconcave conditions.
  Our convergence results improve the ones in prior works under the same conditions
  of objective functions. The key idea in our analysis is to use the classic singular
  perturbation theory and coupling Lyapunov functions to address the time-scale difference
  and interactions between the gradient descent and ascent dynamics. Our results on
  the behavior of continuous-time algorithm may be used to enhance the convergence
  properties of its discrete-time counterpart.
