title: Data-Driven Chance Constrained Control using Kernel Distribution Embeddings
abstract: We present a data-driven algorithm for efficiently computing stochastic
  control policies for general joint chance constrained optimal control problems.
  Our approach leverages the theory of kernel distribution embeddings, which allows
  representing expectation operators as inner products in a reproducing kernel Hilbert
  space. This framework enables approximately reformulating the original problem using
  a dataset of observed trajectories from the system without imposing prior assumptions
  on the parameterization of the system dynamics or the structure of the uncertainty.
  By optimizing over a finite subset of stochastic open-loop control trajectories,
  we relax the original problem to a linear program over the control parameters that
  can be efficiently solved using standard convex optimization techniques. We demonstrate
  our proposed approach in simulation on a system with nonlinear non-Markovian dynamics
  navigating in a cluttered environment.
