title: Time Varying Regression with Hidden Linear Dynamics
abstract: We revisit a model for time-varying linear regression that assumes the unknown
  parameters evolve according to a linear dynamical system. Counterintuitively, we
  show that when the underlying dynamics are stable the parameters of this model can
  be estimated from data by combining just two ordinary least squares estimates. We
  offer a finite sample guarantee on the estimation error of our method and discuss
  certain advantages it has over Expectation-Maximization (EM), which is the main
  approach proposed by prior work.
