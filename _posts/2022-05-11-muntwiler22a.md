title: Learning-based Moving Horizon Estimation through Differentiable Convex Optimization
  Layers
abstract: To control a dynamical system it is essential to obtain an accurate estimate
  of the current system state based on uncertain sensor measurements and existing
  system knowledge. An optimization-based moving horizon estimation (MHE) approach
  uses a dynamical model of the system, and further allows for integration of physical
  constraints on system states and uncertainties, to obtain a trajectory of state
  estimates. In this work, we address the problem of state estimation in the case
  of constrained linear systems with parametric uncertainty. The proposed approach
  makes use of differentiable convex optimization layers to formulate an MHE state
  estimator for systems with uncertain parameters. This formulation allows us to obtain
  the gradient of a squared and regularized output error, based on sensor measurements
  and state estimates, with respect to the current belief of the unknown system parameters.
  The parameters within the MHE problem can then be updated online using stochastic
  gradient descent (SGD) to improve the performance of the MHE. In a numerical example
  of estimating temperatures of a group of manufacturing machines, we show the performance
  of tuning the unknown system parameters and the benefits of integrating physical
  state constraints in the MHE formulation.
