title: Mixtures of Controlled Gaussian Processes for Dynamical Modeling of Deformable
  Objects
abstract: Control and manipulation of objects is a highly relevant topic in Robotics
  research. Although significant advances have been made over the manipulation of
  rigid bodies, the manipulation of non-rigid objects is still challenging and an
  open problem. Due to the uncertainty of the outcome when applying physical actions
  to non-rigid objects, using prior knowledge on objects’ dynamics can greatly improve
  the control performance. However, fitting such models is a challenging task for
  materials such as clothing, where the state is represented by points in a mesh,
  resulting in very large dimensionality that makes models difficult to learn, process
  and predict based on measured data. In this paper, we expand previous work on Controlled
  Gaussian Process Dynamical Models (CGPDM), a method that uses a non-linear projection
  of the state space onto a much smaller dimensional latent space, and learns the
  object dynamics in the latent space. We take advantage of the variability in training
  data by employing Mixture of Experts (MoE), and we devise theory and experimental
  validations that demonstrate significant improvements in training and prediction
  times, plus robustness and error stability when predicting deformable objects exposed
  to disparate movement ranges.
