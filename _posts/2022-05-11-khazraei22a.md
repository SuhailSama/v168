title: Resiliency of Perception-Based Controllers Against Attacks
abstract: This work focuses on resiliency of learning-enabled perception-based controllers
  for nonlinear dynamical systems. We consider systems equipped with an end-to-end
  controller, mapping the perception (e.g., camera images) and sensor measurements
  to control inputs, as well as a statistical or learning-based anomaly detector (AD).
  We define a general notion of attack stealthiness and find conditions for which
  there exists a sequence of stealthy attacks on perception and sensor measurements
  that forces the system into unsafe operation without being detected, for any employed
  AD. Specifically, we show that systems with unstable physical plants and exponentially
  stable closed-loop dynamics are vulnerable to such stealthy attacks. Finally, we
  use our results on a case-study.
