title: Adaptive Model Predictive Control by Learning Classifiers
abstract: Stochastic model predictive control has been a successful and robust control
  framework for many robotics tasks where the system dynamics model is slightly inaccurate
  or in the presence of environment disturbances. Despite the successes, it is still
  unclear how to best adjust control parameters to the current task in the presence
  of model parameter uncertainty and heteroscedastic noise. In this paper, we propose
  an adaptive MPC variant that automatically estimates control and model parameters
  by leveraging ideas from Bayesian optimisation (BO) and the classical expected improvement
  acquisition function. We leverage recent results showing that BO can be reformulated
  via density ratio estimation, which can be efficiently approximated by simply learning
  a classifier. This is then integrated into a model predictive path integral control
  framework yielding robust controllers for a variety of challenging robotics tasks.
  We demonstrate the approach on classical control problems under model uncertainty
  and robotics manipulation tasks.
