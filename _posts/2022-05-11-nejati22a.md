title: Data-Driven Controller Synthesis of Unknown Nonlinear Polynomial Systems via
  Control Barrier Certificates
abstract: In this work, we propose a data-driven approach to synthesize safety controllers
  for continuous-time nonlinear polynomial-type systems with unknown dynamics. The
  proposed framework is based on notions of so-called control barrier certificates,
  constructed from data while providing a guaranteed confidence of 1 on the safety
  of unknown systems. Under a certain rank condition, we synthesize polynomial state-feedback
  controllers to ensure the safety of the unknown system only via a single trajectory
  collected from it. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed results by applying
  them to a nonlinear polynomial-type system with unknown dynamics.
