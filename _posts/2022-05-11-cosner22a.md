title: Safety-Aware Preference-Based Learning for Safety-Critical Control
abstract: Bringing dynamic robots into the wild requires a tenuous balance between
  performance and safety. Yet controllers designed to provide robust safety guarantees
  often result in conservative behavior, and tuning these controllers to find the
  ideal trade-off between performance and safety typically requires domain expertise
  or a carefully constructed reward function. This work presents a design paradigm
  for systematically achieving behaviors that balance performance and robust safety
  by integrating safety-aware Preference-Based Learning (PBL) with Control Barrier
  Functions (CBFs). Fusing these concepts—safety-aware learning and safety-critical
  control—gives a robust means to achieve safe behaviors on complex robotic systems
  in practice. We demonstrate the capability of this design paradigm to achieve safe
  and performant perception-based autonomous operation of a quadrupedal robot both
  in simulation and experimentally on hardware.
