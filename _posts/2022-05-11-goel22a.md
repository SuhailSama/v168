title: Online Estimation and Control with Optimal Pathlength Regret
abstract: A natural goal when designing online learning algorithms for non-stationary
  environments is to bound the regret of the algorithm in terms of the temporal variation
  of the input sequence. Intuitively, when the variation is small, it should be easier
  for the algorithm to achieve low regret, since past observations are predictive
  of future inputs. Such data-dependent "pathlength" regret bounds have recently been
  obtained for a wide variety of online learning problems, including online convex
  optimization (OCO) and bandits. We obtain the first pathlength regret bounds for
  online control and estimation (e.g. Kalman filtering) in linear dynamical systems.
  The key idea in our derivation is to reduce pathlength-optimal filtering and control
  to certain variational problems in robust estimation and control; these reductions
  may be of independent interest.  Numerical simulations confirm that our pathlength-optimal
  algorithms outperform traditional H-2 and H-infinity algorithms when the environment
  varies over time.
