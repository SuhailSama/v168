title: Joint Synthesis of Safety Certificate and Safe Control Policy Using Constrained
  Reinforcement Learning
abstract: Safety is the major consideration in controlling complex dynamical systems
  using reinforcement learning (RL), where the safety certificates can provide provable
  safety guarantees. A valid safety certificate is an energy function indicating that
  safe states are with low energy, and there exists a corresponding safe control policy
  that allows the energy function to always dissipate. The safety certificates and
  the safe control policies are closely related to each other and both challenging
  to synthesize. Therefore, existing learning-based studies treat either of them as
  prior knowledge to learn the other, limiting their applicability to general systems
  with unknown dynamics. This paper proposes a novel approach that simultaneously
  synthesizes the energy-function-based safety certificates and learns the safe control
  policies with constrained reinforcement learning (CRL). We do not rely on prior
  knowledge about either a prior control law or a perfect safety certificate. In particular,
  we formulate a loss function to optimize the safety certificate parameters by minimizing
  the occurrence of energy increases. By adding this optimization procedure as an
  outer loop to the Lagrangian-based CRL, we jointly update the policy and safety
  certificate parameters, and prove that they will converge to their respective local
  optima, the optimal safe policies and valid safety certificates. Finally, we evaluate
  our algorithms on multiple safety-critical benchmark environments. The results show
  that the proposed algorithm learns solidly safe policies with no constraint violation.
  The validity, or feasibility of synthesized safety certificates is also verified
  numerically.
