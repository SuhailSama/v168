title: 'Data-Enabled Gradient Flow as Feedback Controller: Regulation of Linear Dynamical
  Systems to Minimizers of Unknown Functions'
abstract: This paper considers the problem of regulating a linear dynamical system
  to the solution of a convex optimization problem with an unknown or partially-known
  cost. We design a data-driven feedback controller – based on gradient flow dynamics
  – that (i) is augmented with learning methods to estimate the cost function based
  on infrequent (and possibly noisy) functional evaluations; and, concurrently, (ii)
  is designed to drive the inputs and outputs of the dynamical system to the optimizer
  of the problem. We derive sufficient conditions on the learning error and the controller
  gain to ensure that the error between the optimizer of the problem and the state
  of the closed-loop system is ultimately bounded; the error bound accounts for the
  functional estimation errors and the temporal variability of the unknown disturbance
  affecting the linear dynamical system. Our results directly lead to exponential
  input-to-state stability of the closed-loop system. The proposed method and the
  theoretical bounds are validated numerically.
