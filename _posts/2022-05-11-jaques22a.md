title: Vision-based System Identification and 3D Keypoint Discovery using Dynamics
  Constraints
abstract: This paper introduces V-SysId, a novel method that enables simultaneous
  keypoint discovery, 3D system identification, and extrinsic camera calibration from
  an unlabeled video taken from a static camera, using only the family of equations
  of motion of the object of interest as weak supervision. V-SysId takes keypoint
  trajectory proposals and alternates between maximum likelihood parameter estimation
  and extrinsic camera calibration, before applying a suitable selection criterion
  to identify the track of interest. This is then used to train a keypoint tracking
  model using supervised learning. Results on a range of settings (robotics, physics,
  physiology) highlight the utility of this approach.
