title: Modeling Partially Observable Systems using Graph-Based Memory and Topological
  Priors
abstract: Solving partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) is critical
  when applying reinforcement learning to real-world problems, where agents have an
  incomplete view of the world. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are the defacto approach
  for solving POMDPs in reinforcement learning (RL). Although they perform well in
  supervised learning, noisy gradients reduce their capabilities in RL. Furthermore,
  they cannot utilize prior human knowledge to bootstrap or stabilize learning. This
  leads researchers to hand-design task-specific memory models based on their prior
  knowledge of the task at hand. In this paper, we present graph convolutional memory
  (GCM), the first RL memory framework with swappable task-specific priors, enabling
  users to inject expertise into their models. GCM uses human-defined topological
  priors to form graph neighborhoods, combining them into a larger network topology.
  We query the graph using graph convolution, coalescing relevant memories into a
  context-dependent summary of the past. Results demonstrate that GCM outperforms
  state of the art methods on control, memorization, and navigation tasks while using
  fewer parameters.
