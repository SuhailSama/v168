title: 'Barrier Bayesian Linear Regression: Online Learning of Control Barrier Conditions
  for Safety-Critical Control of Uncertain Systems'
abstract: In this work, we consider the problem of designing a safety filter for a
  nonlinear uncertain control system. Our goal is to augment an arbitrary controller
  with a safety filter such that the overall closed-loop system is guaranteed to stay
  within a given state constraint set, referred to as being safe. For systems with
  known dynamics, control barrier functions (CBFs) provide a scalar condition for
  determining if a system is safe. For uncertain systems, robust or adaptive CBF certification
  approaches have been proposed. However, these approaches can be conservative or
  require the system to have a particular parametric structure. For more generic uncertain
  systems,   machine learning approaches have been used to approximate the CBF condition.
  These works typically assume that the learning module is sufficiently trained prior
  to deployment. Safety during learning is not guaranteed.  We propose a barrier Bayesian
  linear regression (BBLR) approach that  guarantees safe online learning of the CBF
  condition for the true, uncertain system. We assume that the error between the  nominal
  system and the true system is bounded and exploit the structure of the CBF condition.
  We show that our approach can safely expand the set of certifiable control inputs
  despite system and learning uncertainties. The effectiveness of our approach is
  demonstrated in simulation using a two-dimensional pendulum stabilization task.
