title: On the Effectiveness of Iterative Learning Control
abstract: Iterative learning control (ILC) is a powerful technique for high performance
  tracking in the presence of modeling errors for optimal control applications.  There
  is extensive prior work showing its empirical effectiveness in applications such
  as chemical reactors, industrial robots and quadcopters. However, there is little
  prior theoretical work that explains the effectiveness of ILC even in the presence
  of large modeling errors, where optimal control methods using the misspecified model
  (MM) often perform poorly. Our work presents such a theoretical study of the performance
  of both ILC and MM on Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problems with unknown transition
  dynamics. We show that the suboptimality gap, as measured with respect to the optimal
  LQR controller, for ILC is lower than that for MM by higher order terms that become
  significant in the regime of high modeling errors. A key part of our analysis is
  the perturbation bounds for the discrete Ricatti equation in the finite horizon
  setting, where the solution is not a fixed point and requires tracking the error
  using recursive bounds. We back our theoretical findings with empirical experiments
  on a toy linear dynamical system with an approximate model, a nonlinear inverted
  pendulum system with misspecified mass, and a nonlinear planar quadrotor system
  in the presence of wind.  Experiments show that ILC outperforms MM significantly,
  in terms of the cost of computed trajectories, when modeling errors are high.
