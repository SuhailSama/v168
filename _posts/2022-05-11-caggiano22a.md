title: 'MyoSuite: A Contact-rich Simulation Suite for Musculoskeletal Motor Control'
abstract: 'Embodied agents in continuous control domains have been traditionally exposed
  to tasks with limited opportunity to explore musculoskeletal details that enable
  agile and nimble behaviors in biological beings. The sophistication behind bio-musculoskeletal
  control not only poses new challenges for the learning community but realizing agents
  embedded in the same perception-action loop that the human sensory-motor system
  solves can also have a far-reaching impact in fields of neuro-motor disorders, rehabilitation,
  assistive technologies, as well as collaborative-robotics.  Human biomechanics is
  a complex multi-joint-multi-actuator musculoskeletal system. The sensory-motor system
  relies on a range of sensory-contact rich and proprioceptive inputs that define
  and condition motor actuation required to exhibit intelligent behaviors in the physical
  world. Current frameworks for studying musculoskeletal control do not include at
  the same time the needed physiological sophistication of the musculoskeletal systems
  and support physical world interaction capabilities. In addition, they are neither
  embedded in complex and skillful motor tasks nort are computationally effective
  and scalable to study motor learning in the timescale that current learning paradigms
  require.  To realize a platform where physiological detail and challenges behind
  human motor control can be investigated, we present a suite of physiologically accurate
  biomechanical models of elbow, wrist, and hand, with physical contact capabilities
  which allow complex and skillful contact-rich real-world tasks. The implemented
  motor tasks provide a great variability of control challenges: from simple postural
  control to skilled hand-object interactions involving tasks like turning a key,
  twirling a pen, rotating two balls in one hand, etc. Finally, by supporting physiological
  alterations in musculoskeletal geometry (tendon transfer), assistive devices (exoskeleton
  assistance), and muscle contraction dynamics (muscle fatigue, sarcopenia), we present
  real-life tasks with temporal changes, thereby exposing realistic non-stationary
  conditions in our tasks which most continuous control benchmarks lack. Project Webpage:
