title: Symplectic Momentum Neural Networks - Using Discrete Variational Mechanics
  as a prior in Deep Learning
abstract: With deep learning being gaining increase from the research community for
  prediction and control of real physical systems, learning important representations
  is becoming now more than ever mandatory. It is of extreme importance that deep
  learning representations are coherent with physics. When learning from discrete
  data this can be guaranteed by including some sort of prior into the learning, however
  not all discretization priors preserve important structures from the physics. In
  this paper we introduce Symplectic Momentum Neural Networks (SyMo) as models from
  a discrete formulation of mechanics for non-separable mechanical systems. The combination
  of such formulation leads SyMos to be constrained towards preserving important geometric
  structures such as momentum and a symplectic form and learn from limited data. Furthermore,
  it allows to learn dynamics only from the poses as training data. We extend SyMos
  to include variational integrators within the learning framework by developing an
  implicit root-find layer which leads to End-to-End Symplectic Momentum Neural Networks
  (E2E-SyMo). Through experimental results, using the pendulum and cartpole we show
  that such combination not only allows these models to learn from limited data but
  also provides the models with the capability of preserving the symplectic form and
  show better long-term behaviour.
