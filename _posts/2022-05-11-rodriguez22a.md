title: 'Neural Gaits: Learning Bipedal Locomotion via Control Barrier Functions and
  Zero Dynamics Policies'
abstract: 'This work presents Neural Gaits, a method for learning dynamic walking
  gaits through the enforcement of set invariance that can be refined episodically
  using experimental data from the robot.  We first frame walking as a set invariance
  problem enforceable via control barrier functions (CBFs) defined on the reduced-order
  dynamics quantifying the underactuated component of the robot: the zero dynamics.
  Our approach contains two learning modules: one for learning a policy that satisfies
  the CBF condition, and another for learning a residual dynamics model to refine
  imperfections of the nominal model. Importantly, learning only over the zero dynamics
  significantly reduces the dimensionality of the learning problem while using CBFs
  allows us to still make guarantees for the full-order system. Finally, the applicability
  of the method is demonstrated experimentally on an underactuated bipedal robot,
  where we are able to show agile and dynamic locomotion, even with partially unknown
  dynamics.'
