title: Can Foundation Models Perform Zero-Shot Task Specification For Robot Manipulation?
abstract: " Task specification is at the core of programming autonomous robots. A
  low-effort modality for task specification is critical for engagement of non-expert
  end users and ultimate adoption of personalized robot agents. A widely studied approach
  to task specification is through goals, using either  compact state space vectors
  or goal images from the same robot scene. The former is often not easily human interpretable
  and necessitates detailed state estimation and scene understanding. The latter requires
  the generation of desired goal image, which often requires a human to complete the
  task, defeating the purpose of having autonomous robots. In this work, we explore
  alternate and more general forms of goal specification that are expected to be easier
  for humans to specify and use such as images obtained from the internet, hand sketches
  that provide a visual description of the desired task, or simple language descriptions.
  As a first step towards this, we study the capabilities of large scale pre-trained
  models (foundation models) for zero-shot goal specification, and find that they
  are surprisingly effective in a collection of simulated robot manipulation tasks
  and real-world datasets."
