title: 'Deep Interactive Motion Prediction and Planning: Playing Games with Motion
  Prediction Models'
abstract: In most classical Autonomous Vehicle (AV) stacks, the prediction and planning
  layers are separated, limiting the planner to react to predictions that are not
  informed by the planned trajectory of the AV. This work presents a module that tightly
  couples these layers via a game-theoretic Model Predictive Controller (MPC) that
  uses a novel interactive multi-agent neural network policy as part of its predictive
  model. In our setting, the MPC planner considers all the surrounding agents by informing
  the multi-agent policy with the planned state sequence. Fundamental to the success
  of our method is the design of a novel multi-agent policy network that can steer
  a vehicle given the state of the surrounding agents and the map information. The
  policy network is trained implicitly with ground-truth observation data using backpropagation
  through time and a differentiable dynamics model to roll out the trajectory forward
  in time. Finally, we show that our multi-agent policy network learns to drive while
  interacting with the environment, and, when combined with the game-theoretic MPC
  planner, can successfully generate interactive behaviors.
