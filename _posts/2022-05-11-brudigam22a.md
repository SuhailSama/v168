title: Structure-Preserving Learning Using Gaussian Processes and Variational Integrators
abstract: Gaussian process regression is increasingly applied for learning unknown
  dynamical systems. In particular, the implicit quantification of the uncertainty
  of the learned model makes it a promising approach for safety-critical applications.
  When using Gaussian process regression to learn unknown systems, a commonly considered
  approach consists of learning the residual dynamics after applying some generic
  discretization technique, which might however disregard properties of the underlying
  physical system. Variational integrators are a less common yet promising approach
  to discretization, as they retain physical properties of the underlying system,
  such as energy conservation and satisfaction of explicit kinematic constraints.
  In this work, we present a novel structure-preserving learning-based modelling approach
  that combines a variational integrator for the nominal dynamics of a mechanical
  system and learning residual dynamics with Gaussian process regression. We extend
  our approach to systems with known kinematic constraints and provide formal bounds
  on the prediction uncertainty. The simulative evaluation of the proposed method
  shows desirable energy conservation properties in accordance with general theoretical
  results and demonstrates exact constraint satisfaction for constrained dynamical
  systems.
