title: Certified Robustness via Locally Biased Randomized Smoothing
abstract: The successful incorporation of machine learning models into safety-critical
  control systems requires rigorous robustness guarantees. Randomized smoothing remains
  one of the state-of-the-art methods for robustification with theoretical guarantees.
  We show that using uniform and unbiased smoothing measures, as is standard in the
  literature, relies on the underlying assumption that smooth decision boundaries
  yield good robustness, which manifests into a robustness-accuracy tradeoff. We generalize
  the smoothing framework to remove this assumption and learn a locally optimal robustification
  of the decision boundary based on training data, a method we term locally biased
  randomized smoothing. We prove nontrivial closed-form certified robust radii for
  the resulting model, avoiding Monte Carlo certifications as used by other smoothing
  methods. Experiments on synthetic, MNIST, and CIFAR-10 data show a notable increase
  in the certified radii and accuracy over conventional smoothing.
