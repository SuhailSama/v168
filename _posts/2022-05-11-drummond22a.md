title: Bounding the Difference Between Model Predictive Control and Neural Networks
abstract: 'There is a growing debate on whether the future of feedback control systems
  will be dominated by data-driven or model-driven approaches. Each of these two approaches
  has their own complimentary set of advantages and disadvantages, however, only limited
  attempts have, so far, been developed to bridge the gap between them. To address
  this issue, this paper introduces a method to bound the worst-case error between
  feedback control policies based upon model predictive control (MPC) and neural networks
  (NNs). This result is leveraged into an approach to automatically synthesize MPC
  policies minimising the worst-case error with respect to a NN. Numerical examples
  highlight the application of the bounds, with the goal of the paper being to encourage
  a more quantitative understanding of the relationship between  data-driven and model-driven
  control. '
