title: Optimal Pointing Sequences in Spacecraft Formation Flying Using Online Planning
  with Resource Constraints
abstract: 'In spacecraft formation flying, establishing inter-satellite communication
  links is critical for data exchange and relative satellite navigation. In large
  formations, establishing links between the reference chief and all deputy satellites
  can weigh heavily on mission execution time and resources. This study strives to
  find the optimal sequence of pointing decisions for a single chief spacecraft to
  the entire formation, while respecting practical resource constraints such as power
  budgeting. The sequential decision making problem is formulated as a Markov decision
  process (MDP) and solved as a shortest path problem. Two-body astrodynamics and
  rigid body dynamics are assumed in the simulation. We compared several policies:
  a random policy, two types of greedy policies, one-step look-ahead, and forward
  tree search. Policies were tested on a single demonstration scenario, and then tested
  on 1,000 Monte Carlo trials using randomized formation geometries. The total pointing
  mission execution times and the relative runtimes were assessed across these policies.
  Results show effectiveness in finding the shortest sequential pointing sequence,
  demonstrating promise in autonomous decision making for spacecraft attitude control
  in future missions.'
