title: 'Neighborhood Mixup Experience Replay: Local Convex Interpolation for Improved
  Sample Efficiency in Continuous Control Tasks'
abstract: Experience replay plays a crucial role in improving the sample efficiency
  of deep reinforcement learning agents. Recent advances in experience replay propose
  using Mixup (Zhang et al., 2018) to further improve sample efficiency via synthetic
  sample generation. We build upon this technique with Neighborhood Mixup Experience
  Replay (NMER), a geometrically-grounded replay buffer that interpolates transitions
  with their closest neighbors in state-action space. NMER preserves a locally linear
  approximation of the transition manifold by only applying Mixup between transitions
  with vicinal state-action features. Under NMER, a given transitionâ€™s set of state
  action neighbors is dynamic and episode agnostic, in turn encouraging greater policy
  generalizability via inter-episode interpolation. We combine our approach with recent
  off-policy deep reinforcement learning algorithms and evaluate on continuous control
  environments. We observe that NMER improves sample efficiency by an average 94%
  (TD3) and 29% (SAC) over baseline replay buffers, enabling agents to effectively
  recombine previous experiences and learn from limited data.
