title: On the Heterogeneity of Independent Learning Dynamics in Zero-sum Stochastic
  Games
abstract: We analyze the convergence properties of the two-timescale fictitious play
  combining the classical fictitious play with the Q-learning for two-player zero-sum
  stochastic games with player-dependent learning rates. We show its almost sure convergence
  under the standard assumptions in two-timescale stochastic approximation methods
  when the discount factor is less than the product of the ratios of player-dependent
  step sizes. To this end, we formulate a novel Lyapunov function formulation and
  present a one-sided asynchronous convergence result.
