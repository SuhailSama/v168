title: Adaptive Stochastic MPC under Unknown Noise Distribution
abstract: In this paper, we address the stochastic MPC (SMPC) problem for linear systems,
  subject to chance state constraints and hard input constraints, under unknown noise
  distribution. First, we reformulate the chance state constraints as deterministic
  constraints depending only on explicit noise statistics. Based on these reformulated
  constraints, we design a distributionally robust and robustly stable benchmark SMPC
  algorithm for the ideal setting of known noise statistics. Then, we employ this
  benchmark controller to derive a novel robustly stable adaptive SMPC scheme that
  learns the necessary noise statistics online, while guaranteeing time-uniform satisfaction
  of the unknown reformulated state constraints with high probability. The latter
  is achieved through the use of confidence intervals which rely on the empirical
  noise statistics and are valid uniformly over time. Moreover, control performance
  is improved over time as more noise samples are gathered and better estimates of
  the noise statistics are obtained, given the online adaptation of the estimated
  reformulated constraints. Additionally, in tracking problems with multiple successive
  targets our approach leads to an online-enlarged domain of attraction compared to
  robust tube-based MPC. A numerical simulation of a DC-DC converter is used to demonstrate
  the effectiveness of the developed methodology.
