title: Clustering-based Mode Reduction for Markov Jump Systems
abstract: While Markov jump systems (MJSs) are more appropriate than LTI systems in
  terms of modeling abruptly changing dynamics, MJSs (and other switched systems)
  may suffer from the model complexity brought by the potentially sheer number of
  switching modes. Much of the existing work on reducing switched systems focuses
  on the state space where techniques such as discretization and dimension reduction
  are performed, yet reducing mode complexity receives few attention. In this work,
  inspired by clustering techniques from unsupervised learning, we propose a reduction
  method for MJS such that a mode-reduced MJS can be constructed with guaranteed approximation
  performance. Furthermore, we show how this reduced MJS can be used in designing
  controllers for the original MJS to reduce the computation cost while maintaining
  guaranteed suboptimality.
