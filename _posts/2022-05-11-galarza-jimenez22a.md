title: 'Sliding-Seeking Control: Model-Free Optimization with Safety Constraints'
abstract: 'This paper considers the design of online model-free algorithms for the
  solution of convex optimization problems with a time-varying cost function. We propose
  an online switched zeroth-order algorithm where: i) different vector fields are
  implemented based on whether constraints are satisfied; and, ii) zeroth-order dynamics
  are leveraged to obtain estimates of the (time-varying) gradients in the algorithmic
  updates. The zeroth-order strategy is suitable for cases where the optimizer has
  access to functional evaluations of the cost and constraints, but has no knowledge
  of their functional form. The proposed online algorithm guarantees finite-time feasibility
  (while avoiding projections) and it exhibits asymptotic stability to a neighborhood
  of the optimal trajectory of the time-varying problem. Results are established for
  cost functions that are strictly convex and twice continuously differentiable. Illustrative
  numerical results are presented to showcase the main properties of the algorithm.'
