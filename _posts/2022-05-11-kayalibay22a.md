title: Tracking and Planning with Spatial World Models
abstract: We introduce a method for real-time navigation and tracking with differentiably
  rendered world models. Learning models for control has led to impressive results
  in robotics and computer games, but this success has yet to be extended to vision-based
  navigation. To address this, we transfer advances in the emergent field of differentiable
  rendering to model-based control. We do this by planning in a learned 3D spatial
  world model, combined with a pose estimation algorithm previously used in the context
  of TSDF fusion, but now tailored to our setting and improved to incorporate agent
  dynamics. We evaluate over six simulated environments based on complex human-designed
  floor plans and provide quantitative results. We achieve up to 92% navigation success
  rate at a frequency of 15 Hz using only image and depth observations under stochastic,
  continuous dynamics.
