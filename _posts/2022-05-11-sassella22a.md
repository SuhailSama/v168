title: 'Noise Handling in Data-driven Predictive Control: A Strategy Based on Dynamic
  Mode Decomposition'
abstract: A major issue when exploiting data for direct control design is noise handling,
  since overlooking or improperly treating noise might have a catastrophic impact
  on closed-loop performance. Nonetheless, standard approaches to mitigate its effect
  might not be easily applicable for data-driven control design, since they often
  require tuning a set of hyper-parameters via potentially unsafe closed-loop experiments.
  By focusing on data-driven predictive control, we propose a noise handling approach
  based on truncated dynamic mode decomposition, along with an automatic tuning strategy
  for its hyper-parameters. By leveraging on pre-processing only, the proposed approach
  allows one to avoid dangerous closed-loop calibrations while being effective in
  coping with noise, as illustrated on a benchmark simulation example.
