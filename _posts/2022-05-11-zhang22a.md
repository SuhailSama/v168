title: Adversarially Robust Stability Certificates can be Sample-Efficient
abstract: Motivated by bridging the simulation to reality gap in the context of safety-critical
  systems, we consider learning adversarially robust stability certificates for unknown
  nonlinear dynamical systems.  In line with approaches from robust control, we consider
  additive and Lipschitz bounded adversaries that perturb the system dynamics.  We
  show that under suitable assumptions of incremental stability on the underlying
  system, the statistical cost of learning an adversarial stability certificate is
  equivalent, up to constant factors, to that of learning a nominal stability certificate.
  Our results hinge on novel bounds for the Rademacher complexity of the resulting
  adversarial loss class, which may be of independent interest.  To the best of our
  knowledge, this is the first characterization of sample-complexity bounds when performing
  adversarial learning over data generated by a dynamical system.  We further provide
  a practical algorithm for approximating the adversarial training algorithm, and
  validate our findings on a damped pendulum example.
