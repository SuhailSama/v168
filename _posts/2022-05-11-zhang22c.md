title: Sample Complexity of the Robust LQG Regulator with Coprime Factors Uncertainty
abstract: This paper addresses the end-to-end sample complexity bound for learning
  the H2 optimal controller (the Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) problem) with unknown
  dynamics, for potentially unstable Linear Time Invariant (LTI) systems. The robust
  LQG synthesis procedure is performed by considering bounded additive model uncertainty
  on the coprime factors of the plant. The closed-loopidentification of the nominal
  model of the true plant is performed by constructing a Hankel-likematrix from a
  single time-series of noisy finite length input-output data, using the ordinary
  least squares algorithm from Sarkar and Rakhlin (2019). Next, an H$\infty$ bound
  on the estimated model error is provided and the robust controller is designed via
  convex optimization, much in the spirit of Mania et al. (2019) and Zheng et al.
  (2020b), while allowing for bounded additive uncertainty on the coprime factors
  of the model. Our conclusions are consistent with previous results on learning the
  LQG and LQR controllers.
