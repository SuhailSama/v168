title: 'Learning Distributed Channel Access Policies for Networked Estimation: Data-driven
  Optimization in the Mean-field Regime'
abstract: The problem of communicating sensor measurements over shared networks is  prevalent
  in many modern large-scale distributed systems such as cyber-physical systems, wireless
  sensor networks and the internet of things. Due to bandwidth constraints, the system
  designer must jointly optimize decentralized medium access transmission and estimation
  policies that accommodate a very large number of devices in extremely contested
  environments such that the collection of all observations is reproduced at the destination
  with the best possible fidelity. We formulate a remote estimation problem in the
  mean-field regime where a very large number of sensors communicate their observations
  to an access point, or base-station, under a strict constraint on the maximum fraction
  of transmitting devices. We show that in the mean-field regime, this problem exhibits
  a structure which enables tractable optimization algorithms. More importantly, we
  obtain a data-driven learning scheme and a characterization of its convergence rate.
