title: 'ValueNetQP: Learned One-step Optimal Control for Legged Locomotion'
abstract: Optimal control is a successful approach to generate motions for complex
  robots, in particular for legged locomotion. However, these techniques are often
  too slow to run in real time for model predictive control or one needs to drastically
  simplify the dynamics model. In this work, we present a method to learn to predict
  the gradient and hessian of the problem value function, enabling fast resolution
  of the predictive control problem with a one-step quadratic program. In addition,
  our method is able to satisfy constraints like friction cones and unilateral constraints,
  which are important for high dynamics locomotion tasks. We demonstrate the capability
  of our method in simulation and on a real quadruped robot performing trotting and
  bounding motions.
