title: 'Data-Driven Safety Verification of Stochastic Systems via Barrier Certificates:
  A Wait-and-Judge Approach'
abstract: We provide a data-driven approach equipped with a formal guarantee for verifying
  the safety of stochastic systems with unknown dynamics. First, using a notion of
  barrier certificates, the safety verification for a stochastic system is cast as
  a robust convex program (RCP). Solving this optimization program is hard because
  the model of the stochastic system, which is unknown, appears in one of the constraints.
  Therefore, we construct a scenario convex program (SCP) by collecting a number of
  samples from trajectories of the system. Then, under some condition over the optimal
  value of the resulted SCP, we are able to relate its optimal decision variables
  to the safety of the original stochastic system and provide a formal out-of-sample
  performance guarantee. Particularly, we propose a so-called wait-and-judge approach
  which a posteriori checks some condition over the optimal value of the SCP for a
  fixed number of sampled data. If the condition is satisfied, then the safety specification
  is satisfied with some probability lower bound and a desired confidence. The effectiveness
  of our approach in requiring only a low number of samples compared to existing results
  in the literature is illustrated on a two-tank system by ensuring that the water
  levels in both tanks never reach a critical zone within a specific time horizon.
