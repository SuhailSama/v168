title: Safe Control with Neural Network Dynamic Models
abstract: 'Safety is critical in autonomous robotic systems. A safe control law should
  ensure forward invariance of a safe set (a subset in the state space). It has been
  extensively studied regarding how to derive a safe control law with a control-affine
  analytical dynamic model. However, how to formally derive a safe control law with
  Neural Network Dynamic Models (NNDM) remains unclear due to the lack of computationally
  tractable methods to deal with these black-box functions. In fact, even finding
  the control that minimizes an objective for NNDM without any safety constraint is
  still challenging. In this work, we propose MIND-SIS (Mixed Integer for Neural network
  Dynamic model with Safety Index Synthesis), the first method to synthesize safe
  control for NNDM. The method includes two parts: 1) SIS: an algorithm for the offline
  synthesis of the safety index (also called as a barrier function), which uses evolutionary
  methods and 2) MIND: an algorithm for online computation of the optimal and safe
  control signal, which solves a constrained optimization using a computationally
  efficient encoding of neural networks. It has been theoretically proved that MIND-SIS
  guarantees forward invariance and finite convergence to a subset of the user-defined
  safe set. And it has been numerically validated that MIND-SIS achieves safe and
  optimal control of NNDM. The optimality gap is less than $10^{-8}$, and the safety
  constraint violation is $0$.'
