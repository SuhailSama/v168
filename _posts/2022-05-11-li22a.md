title: 'Accelerating Model-Free Policy Optimization Using Model-Based Gradient: A
  Composite Optimization Perspective'
abstract: We develop an algorithm that combines model-based and model-free methods
  for solving a nonlinear optimal control problem with a quadratic cost in which the
  system model is given by a linear state-space model with a small additive nonlinear
  perturbation. We decompose the cost into a sum of two functions, one having an explicit
  form obtained from the approximate linear model, the other being a black-box model
  representing the unknown modeling error. The decomposition allows us to formulate
  the problem as a composite optimization problem. To solve the optimization problem,
  our algorithm performs gradient descent using the gradient obtained from the approximate
  linear model until backtracking line search fails, upon which the model-based gradient
  is compared with the exact gradient obtained from a model-free algorithm. The difference
  between the model gradient and the exact gradient is then used for compensating
  future gradient-based updates. Our algorithm is shown to decrease the number of
  function evaluations compared with traditional model-free methods both in theory
  and in practice.
