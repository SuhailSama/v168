title: Neural Point Process for Learning Spatiotemporal Event Dynamics
abstract: Learning the dynamics of spatiotemporal events is a fundamental problem.
  Neural point processes enhance the expressivity of point process models with deep
  neural networks. However, most existing methods only consider temporal dynamics
  without spatial modeling. We propose Deep Spatiotemporal Point Process (DeepSTPP),
  a deep dynamics model that integrates spatiotemporal point processes. Our method
  is flexible, efficient,  and can accurately forecast irregularly sampled events
  over space and time.  The key construction of our approach is the nonparametric
  space-time intensity function, governed by a latent process. The intensity function
  enjoys closed-form integration for the density.  The latent process captures the
  uncertainty of the event sequence. We use amortized variational inference to infer
  the latent process with deep networks. Using synthetic datasets, we validate our
  model can accurately learn the true intensity function. On real-world benchmark
  datasets, our model demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines.
