title: Safe Control with Minimal Regret
abstract: As we move towards safety-critical cyber-physical systems that operate in
  non-stationary and uncertain environments, it becomes crucial to close the gap between
  classical optimal control algorithms and adaptive learning-based methods. In this
  paper, we present an efficient optimization-based approach for computing a finite-horizon
  robustly safe control policy that minimizes dynamic regret, in the sense of the
  loss relative to the optimal sequence of control actions selected in hindsight by
  a clairvoyant controller. By leveraging the system level synthesis framework (SLS),
  our method extends recent results on regret minimization for the linear quadratic
  regulator to optimal control subject to hard safety constraints, and allows competing
  against a safety-aware clairvoyant policy with minor modifications. Numerical experiments
  confirm superior performance with respect to finite-horizon constrained H2 and H-infinity
  control laws when the disturbance realizations poorly fit classical assumptions.
