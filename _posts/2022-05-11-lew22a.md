title: A Simple and Efficient Sampling-based Algorithm for General Reachability Analysis
abstract: In this work, we analyze an efficient sampling-based algorithm for general-purpose
  reachability analysis, which remains a notoriously challenging problem with applications
  ranging from neural network verification to safety analysis of dynamical systems.
  By sampling inputs, evaluating their images in the true reachable set, and taking
  their $\epsilon$-padded convex hull as a set estimator, this algorithm applies to
  general problem settings and is simple to implement. Our main contribution is the
  derivation of asymptotic and finite-sample accuracy guarantees using random set
  theory. This analysis informs algorithmic design to obtain an $\epsilon$-close reachable
  set approximation with high probability, provides insights into which reachability
  problems are most challenging, and motivates safety-critical applications of the
  technique. On a neural network verification task, we show that this approach is
  more accurate and significantly faster than prior work. Informed by our analysis,
  we also design a robust model predictive controller that we demonstrate in hardware
  experiments.
