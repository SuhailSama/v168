title: Automated Design of Grey-Box Recurrent Neural Networks For Fault Diagnosis
  using Structural Models and Causal Information
abstract: Behavioral modeling of nonlinear dynamic systems for control design and
  system monitoring of technical systems is a non-trivial task. One example is fault
  diagnosis where the objective is to detect abnormal system behavior due to faults
  at an early stage and isolate the faulty component. Developing sufficiently accurate
  models for fault diagnosis applications can be a time-consuming process which has
  motivated the use of data-driven models and machine learning. However, data-driven
  fault diagnosis is complicated by the facts that faults are rare events, and that
  it is not always possible to collect data that is representative of all operating
  conditions and faulty behavior. One solution to incomplete training data is to take
  into consideration physical insights when designing the data-driven models. One
  such approach is grey-box recurrent neural networks where physical insights about
  the monitored system are incorporated into the neural network structure. In this
  work, an automated design methodology is developed for grey-box recurrent neural
  networks using a structural representation of the system. Data from an internal
  combustion engine test bench is used to illustrate the potentials of the proposed
  network design method to construct residual generators for fault detection and isolation.
